Question 1
Write code that asks the user to input a number between 1 and 5 inclusive.
The code will take the integer value and print out the string value. So for
example if the user inputs 2 the code will print two. Reject any input that
is not a number in that range

Question 2
Repeat the previous task but this time the user will input a string and the
code will ouput the integer value. Convert the string to lowercase first.

Question 3
Create a variable containing an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive. Ask the

Question 4
Ask the user to input their name. Check the length of the name. If it is

Question 5
Ask the user for two integers between 1 and 20. If they are both greater than
15 return their product. If only one is greater than 15 return their sum, if
neither are greater than 15 return zero

"""
Question 6
Ask the user for two integers, then swap the contents of the variables. So if
